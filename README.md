Summary
This app is intended to give users quick information about the weather in the location they want to hike and gives gear suggestions based on the weather. It runs by using a fetch block to the Open Weather API. Open weather gives free and time sensitive weather updates. The app takes the weather code ID to dynamically give the user recommendations about what gear they should wear on a hike for that day.
